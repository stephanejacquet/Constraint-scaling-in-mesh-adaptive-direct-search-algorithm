+ compile with "g++ -o truth.exe truth.cpp"

+ execute with "./truth.exe ./points/x0.txt"

+ the first output is the objective to minimize

+ the 3 other outputs are constraints with format <= 0

+ the bounds are:

	LOWER_BOUND ( 30.0  6.0 0.28 -1.0 -1.0 1.6 0.30 )
	UPPER_BOUND ( 45.0 12.0 0.50  3.0  3.0 5.0 0.79 )
